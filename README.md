# Hadeel Adres
Leveraging a Bachelor's degree in media informatics from the University of Tuebingen, I bring a solid educational background and expertise in the
latest versions of PHP, TypeScript, and JavaScript to my web development endeavors.
My primary focus has consistently been on crafting engaging and user-centric web applications. I thrive on the details of implementation,
testing, debugging, and continuously enhancing usability and user experience. I possess a fundamental understanding of MVC frameworks like Laravel and
relational databases like MySQL.
Currently, I'm expanding my skillset by delving into the world of UX/UI design, aiming to create not only functional but also visually appealing
and intuitive web experiences.
